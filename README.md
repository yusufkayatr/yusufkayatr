My goal is to establish this company as a major player in the entertainment and advertisement industry, with a strong focus on quality and creativity. With a team of experienced professionals and a commitment to innovation, I’m confident that Tales & Realms will capture the hearts and imaginations of customers across a wide range of markets.


Overall, Tales & Realms aims to bring fresh and engaging content to the market by using new technologies and working directly with customers to deliver what they want.

Tales & Realms aims to become a leading provider of comic books, animation movies, latest technology advertising solutions. The company aims to adapt to the rapidly changing media landscape and capitalize on the opportunities presented by the emergence of Web 3.0,  growing virtual reality and 3D display industry.

My main focus is on developing a series of comic books that will serve as the foundation for the animation movies I plan to create. I believe that by creating a compelling universe of characters and stories, we can establish a loyal fan base that will support our efforts to expand into new media platforms.

In addition to producing our own content, company plans to offer advertising solutions for other companies. We will leverage our expertise in storytelling and animation to create effective and engaging campaigns that resonate with target audiences.

Our goal is to become a major player in the entertainment and advertising industries by producing high-quality content and providing innovative solutions to our clients. We are excited to embark on this journey and look forward to working with investors who share our vision for the future.

Company already have a few stock scenarios for an energy drink company looking to compete with the market leader, and company’s aim is to create viral content for the company who will choose us. As we've seen in the advertising wars between Coca Cola and Pepsi, these campaigns can have a vital role in propelling a company to the top of their sector.

In addition to this advertisement campaign I already have animation scenarios that I want to work on after built a core team. I see one of my scenarios as a flagship that has not made before. It has a huge potential of over 200 million viewers waiting for it quietly in the market. 

I’m a 27-year-old former manager in IT industry and have a keen interest to latest technologies. I’m experienced as a team manager plus I’m good at managing the team’s abilities. I am also good at providing a warm working environment regardless of race, sex and ethnicity.
