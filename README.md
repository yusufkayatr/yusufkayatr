Tales & Realms is an upcoming startup that specializes in creating unique and engaging content that takes customers on a journey beyond reality. Our products and services will cater to multiple customer segments, including:
* B2C: We will offer a range of products, including comic books, 3D printed figures, NFTs, and animation movies that appeal to individuals who are passionate about immersive storytelling.

* B2B2B2C: We will work with multiple parties in a supply chain to deliver products or services to end customers. This involves collaborating with businesses that sell our products to other businesses or institutions, who then offer our products to individual customers.

My goal is to establish this company as a major player in the entertainment and advertisement industry, with a strong focus on quality and creativity. With a team of experienced professionals and a commitment to innovation, I’m confident that Tales & Realms will capture the hearts and imaginations of customers across a wide range of markets.

Tales & Realms is a pre-seed startup that aims to bring exciting and innovative comic books, animation movies, and advertising solutions to the market. The company aims to adapt to the rapidly changing world and embrace new technologies, such as Web 3.0 and virtual reality, 3D displays, to provide unique experiences for its customers. Tales & Realms plans to conduct thorough market analysis and learn from both successful and unsuccessful projects to differentiate its offerings and increase its success rate. The company plans to work directly with customers to gauge their expectations and test new ideas through crowdfunding for upcoming projects (e.g on indiegogo) and perks for pre-orders.
In its first year, Tales & Realms will have a team of experts, including an illustrator, story writer/script writer, animator/animation designer, marketing and social media specialist. As the company grows, it plans to expand its team to include a graphic designer, market research analyst, business development manager, creative director, finance manager, and office clerk. The company is seeking a pre-seed investment of €500,000 in exchange for 30% ownership of the company to kickstart its operations and hire staff.

Overall, Tales & Realms aims to bring fresh and engaging content to the market by using new technologies and working directly with customers to deliver what they want.

Tales & Realms aims to become a leading provider of comic books, animation movies, and latest technology advertising solutions. The company aims to adapt to the rapidly changing media landscape and capitalize on the opportunities presented by the emergence of Web 3.0,  growing virtual reality and 3D display industry.

My main focus is on developing a series of comic books that will serve as the foundation for the animation movies I plan to create. I believe that by creating a compelling universe of characters and stories, we can establish a loyal fan base that will support our efforts to expand into new media platforms.

In addition to producing our own content, company plans to offer advertising solutions for other companies. We will leverage our expertise in storytelling and animation to create effective and engaging campaigns that resonate with target audiences.

Our goal is to become a major player in the entertainment and advertising industries by producing high-quality content and providing innovative solutions to our clients. We are excited to embark on this journey and look forward to working with investors who share our vision for the future.

Company already have a few stock scenarios for an energy drink company looking to compete with the market leader, and company’s aim is to create viral content for the company who will choose us. As we've seen in the advertising wars between Coca Cola and Pepsi, these campaigns can have a vital role in propelling a company to the top of their sector.

In addition to this advertisement campaign I already have animation scenarios that I want to work on after built a core team. I see one of my scenarios as a flagship that has not made before. It has a huge potential of over 200 million viewers waiting for it quietly in the market. 

I’m a 27-year-old former manager in IT industry and have a keen interest to latest technologies. I’m experienced as a team manager plus I’m good at managing the team’s abilities. I am also good at providing a warm working environment regardless of race, sex and ethnicity. 

I have a friend who lives in United States and ready to work with me on this project as a comic book writer/illustrator. If you would like to invest less than I mentioned earlier I can start to make this project just with her and freelance workers from the sector. I can offer 10% ownership in exchange for €170,000. Then you can have a chance to increase the amount your investment. But I need to mention more the team member faster to grow the company.
